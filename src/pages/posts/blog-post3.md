Welcome again travellers.

The last time we spoke we were talking about my first actual run with HTML and the problem I faced with it that made me want to push it away for the time being. 

Fast forward to 2010...

My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer in March of that year, and I stayed home to take care of her, but doing so meant no sleep and I needed something to fill that time. Before she was diagnosed I was introduced to Minecraft by my good friend Chris, and I was intrigued that it was made solely in Java. I thought that was the most impressive thing at the time because everything they were accomplishing in that game was mindblowing even to me. So I spent time doing research and trying to learn the basic fundamentals of how java works, I did the "hello world!" tutorial like every language asks you to do, and I started looking for basic tutorials because that's the easieast way for me to learn..by diving in and following along. 

And boy did I sure pick the most ambitious tutorial to go after....

A 3D game engine built entirely in Java! 

I tried to read as much as I can, but I was following a youtube series and building alongside with the person making it. 

There was a ton I didn't understand, there were bugs that I overcame with hours of reading and trying new things. But it did what I needed it to do...and that was to get my mind off of the pain of what my mother was going through. I needed to keep being strong for her, so I used my new project as a way to keep me focused and always there when she woke up at 2am and needed water. 

That project lasted me until 2017, and although I am not fully done with it...there's a bug I still can't manage to fix and when I am stuck I tend to lose interest and move on to other things. It sits in my github, waiting for me to come back to it and hopefully fix it to continue building it.

After I put that down I didn't do much for a couple more years as I still had some nasty demons in my life to deal with. 

But the next chapter we will tell you about the story of how I overcame those demons, a very beautiful woman, and my re-ignited love for HTML/CSS because of that woman. 

Until then my friends, safe travels.
