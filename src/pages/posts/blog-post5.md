Welcome back my friends, 

I hope you all are well and lets resume our journey to the present and talk about my latest new interest in the realm of full stack web development. 

React...and boy is it fun to use!

This blog site that you are reading this on was built using react and tailwind CSS, while following a tutorial to understand it all more. Videos done by creators help me way more than just reading a huge PDF file, but I still read books on the language I am learning because they go in-depth more than what the video shows me. 

Comments in your code help you learn even more when you need to remember what certain things do, my last project has lots of them, as does my python game project I am working on.

Like recently I was introduced to: 

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)


And this is one amazing "thing" that was built, and I call it that as it's not a library, It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

There are no dependencies to install, just go to the site, use what you need and the code is all yours. I haven't used it yet for anything, but I plan on testing it out and building a mock form to learn more about how I can customize it for my own personal liking so when I build future projects that require using this site, I will have my own personal set of code from there that I will use for my sites only.

Once you dive head first into the world of full stack development you get to learn tons of new things, meet lots of new amazing people, and then your world gets even more so larger. I have a very long way to go on this quest to become full stack, but I enjoy every step of the way.

Until next time my friends, stay safe and see you again soon.
