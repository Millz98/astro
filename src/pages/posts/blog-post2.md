Welcome back, 

Where we left off I gave you a glimpse into how I got to where I am now with programming. The journey had a lot of bumps in the road, there were also times where I pushed it aside to where I tried to ignore it believing it wasn't something I was remotely interested in. 

Boy was I wrong...

But lets just go back a few hundred pages and go to when I started really wanting to use HTML, and it was after I got my own very first computer back in 2005. It was a white tower, sold to me from a friend that I went to computer tech school with. I don't recall the overall specs to it, but I originally got it so I could play all of my favorite MMORPGS at the time, one of them being The Matrix Online, which is not relevant to this story..ish. It's only relevant enough to know that somehow while playing that game I got motivation and inspiration to want to learn coding. 

Most people at that time, acted like I needed to get some kind of degree all the way in Toronto to get into making websites, but I found lots of resources online and tried to get into reading some books from our local library. Now my first attempt at making a site ended up in frustraton, the website was something my 11 year old could have done better even at that time. I spent hours trying to solve my clear as day issue but I ended up giving in and walking away for a while. 

I was stubborn....(Still am)

What I failed to realize was that what webistes need the most besides h1, div and p tags is it needed CSS...and that was one thing I didn't even know anything about. I didn't even know it was reqired at the time. 
  
I felt like a huge failure and at the time I didn't believe in myself enough to continue, because like most I hate failing on things that I work really hard on. 
  
 Now although I am primarily a web developer I do tend to dabble in other languages sometimes when I really want to learn more, but next post we will talk about my time spent playing around with Java, and the 3D engine I couldn't finish making (still to this day the camera bug still plagues me). 
  
Till next time my friends, safe travels. 

test line again to see if this worked. 

Lets add another line!!
