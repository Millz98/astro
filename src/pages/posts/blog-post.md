So the very beginning...its not that much of an origin story when it comes to my beginnings in the world of programming. In early days of elementary school (Grade 3-4 I think?) the current computer science teacher (and was also the vice princial at the time) wheeled one of his computers from the computer lab to give us a demonstration of how MS-DOS and QBasic worked. From that point I was hooked, but my family didn't have the means for such things at the time so I didn't get to do much with computers until around 1993 when my parents got one for their mechanic shop and I would come over a lot after school to use it when my mom wasn't using it. By grade 8 I did a lot with computers in terms of gaming, but it was around that time when I started going on the internet at school, and was starting to learn how to code websites. If I remember correctly, the first really horrible site that I attempted to make was on theglobe.com and it was a red background. a small paragraph, and the words were blue. But it was a beginning, and although it was super horrible, I have definitely grown a huge amount since then and in future posts we will dive more into each moment programming played a huge prominent role in my life before it became essential like it is today!
