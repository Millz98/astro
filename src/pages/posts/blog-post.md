Welcome traveller, 

It does not matter how you got here, it just matters you are here and I do hope that you stay for the journey that lies ahead here on this blog site. My name is Dave Mills, I came from a small town in the middle of nowhere Saskatchewan with hopes and dreams that one day I will make my mark on this world whether it's out there in the world, or online here. 

And you my curious reader are my companion who will get to travel down these posts of the past, present, and future of my journey to being the programmer I have always wanted to be. I can't say now what lies ahead, but I can at least tell you that I will try my best to make them interesting without confusion. 

You don't need to know anything about Coding to come along for this journey, I just would like you to walk with me.

Lets get right to it...the fabled comic book origin story....



So the very beginning...its not that much of an origin story when it comes to my beginnings in the world of programming. In early days of elementary school (Grade 3-4 I think?) the current computer science teacher (and was also the vice princial at the time) wheeled one of his computers from the computer lab to give us a demonstration of how MS-DOS and QBasic worked. From that point I was hooked, but my family didn't have the means for such things at the time so I didn't get to do much with computers until around 1993 when my parents got one for their mechanic shop and I would come over a lot after school to use it when my mom wasn't using it. By grade 8 I did a lot with computers in terms of gaming, but it was around that time when I started going on the internet at school, and was starting to learn how to code websites. If I remember correctly, the first really horrible site that I attempted to make was on theglobe.com and it was a red background. a small paragraph, and the words were blue. But it was a beginning, and although it was super horrible, I have definitely grown a huge amount since then and in future posts we will dive more into each moment programming played a huge prominent role in my life before it became essential like it is today! 

I could easily sit here and list off everything that I have done, am doing, and plan to do...but what's the fun in that?!?! This way it means there will be even more content, with 3 or 4 parters, and possible bad story filler before we get to the next climatic story arc. 

Again welcome, and if you got this far..thank you for reading and please stay a while.
