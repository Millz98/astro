Welcome back companions,

So this is it...the finale post in the origins of my coding past, the one that bridges everything from then to where I am today. It doesn't seem like its long on a blog page, but I didn't want to write a nevel and have you all bored before we even get to the current state of things. 

So back in 2019 I was at a major loss..I was in a super toxic relationship, I lost my favorite apartment, and I was a huge alcoholic. Life sure seemed great right? That was sarcasm, don't answer that. 

Fast forward to september 2019

This amazing woman I now call my fiancee enters my life and flips it around to where I thought I knew love...but boy I was so wrong and felt like I was lying to myself all these years. 

So we fall in love..

Fast forward again to 2021....January

We moved into our first house together and thanks to my lovely demons shes moved back out in 2 weeks, leaving me to keep feeding those demons and feeling sorry for myself in an empty house. 

I do what a lot of alcoholics have a hard time doing and I call my sister and ask for help. 

I move out of that house and into my sisters place in a town 30 mins north of the city. 

During all of that time my fiancee and I are still together, and life is much more clearer when I am alcohol free, going to AA meetings, and taking my life back. 

During the late nights I couldn't sleep I was on my PC slowly getting my love back for coding. Watching videos, doing HTML/CSS excercises and overall just trying to re-acquaint myself with a language I thought I had almost forgotten. 

fast forward to today.....

We now live in another house in the city, with the kids. As of this writing I am now 837 days sober, and this November we will have lived in this house for 2 years so far. 

I have this amazing passion for coding...so much that I have branched out to learn more web dev languages like react and node.js because I want to become a full stack web developer, and not just a coder who makes pretty websites. 

When you really get into things and see all that there is out there to use for coding, its mind blowing and it feels like another adventure waiting to happen. 

And now every post after this one is going to chronicle these journeys, buidling new things and learning new technologies. 

Will you still join me on these grand new adventures? 

Until then my friends, safe travels!
